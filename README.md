## Setting Up
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the pre-requisite software:
    * [Fairseq-py](http://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq-py)
    * [Subword-NMT](https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt)
    * [N-best Reranker](https://github.com/nusnlp/nbest-reranker/)
  For training models, we suggest that you download the exact revisions of the above software. Go to `software/` directory and run `download.sh` directory to download the exact revisions of these software.
3. Compile and install Fairseq-py.


## For testing with pre-trained models
1. Go to `data/` directory and run `prepare_test_data.sh` script to download and process CoNLL-2014 test dataset
2. Go to `models/` directory and run `download.sh` to download the required model files
3. For running the system, run the `run.sh` script with the following format 
```
./run.sh <input-file> <output-directory> <gpu-device-number> <models-path>
````
`<input-file>`: path to tokenized input data
`<gpu-device-number>`: typically 0,1,2 etc to be used with the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
`<models-path>`: could be the path to a single model file or a directory having multiple model files alone.

You can also run the script by adding optional arguments for re-ranking
```
./run.sh <input-file> <output-directory> <gpu-device-number> <models-path> <weights-file> <features>
````
 `<wegihts-file>`: path to trained feature weights for the re-ranker (within `models/reranker_weights`
 `<features>`: use 'eo' for edit operation features, and 'eolm' for both edit operations and language model features. 



## For training from scratch
In the `training/` directory, within the `preprocess.sh` script, place paths to the the training datasets and development datasets. The source and target files must be tokenized.
1. Go to `training/` directory
2. Run `./preprocess.sh` script
3. To train the models by initializing with pre-trained word embeddings, run `train_embed.sh`. To train the models without pre-trainined embeddings use the `train.sh` script instead.
4. To train the re-ranker, you would additionally need to have compiled [Moses](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder) software. Run `train_reranker.sh` script with the following arguments:
```
./train_reranker.sh <output_dir> <gpu-device-number> <models-path> <path-to-moses>
```
`<output-dir>`: directory to store temporary files and final output `weights.txt` file.
